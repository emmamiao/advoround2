My submission for the Advocate Tech Board, Round 2, 2023. 

My project is a random poem generator from a collection of Emily Dickinson poems. For the data, I used the Project Gutenberg database of copyright-expired Emily Dickinson poems (found here https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/12242). I cleaned the data, seperated the sections and poems individually, and then from that dictionary, generated poems. This project is written in Python and has the potential to become a twitter bot, a webpage, etc.

How to use: Run the main block of code to get a new poem each time!

Thanks, and hope you enjoy xoxox

For love is immortality."
